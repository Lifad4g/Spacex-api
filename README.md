# spacex-api
# I could not impelemt the back to login button and register button forwarding the main page
Based on my research it has to <router-link: :to name:(designed page) </router-link> 
If i could successfully impelemt this home screen would be the register page afterwards login then launches


#example of user registration
##https://prnt.sc/1yk5vff
##Default first page
## http://localhost:8080/#/
## Quick access links
## http://localhost:8080/#/login
## http://localhost:8080/#/register
## http://localhost:8080/#/notfound
## http://localhost:8080/#/launch/108 Example launch for quick access there is 108 launches. Did not want to use more than 100 because API's response was slow
